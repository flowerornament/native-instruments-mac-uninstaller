# Native Instruments Mac Uninstaller

Vibe-coded shell script to safely uninstall Native Instruments content on Mac âœ¨

## Back-story

For years I've had various broken Native Instruments packages on my machines unable to be repaired or removed by the Native Access app.

As far as I can tell, this script safely removes any app, instrument, or effect you want.

## Good to know

- Rather than `rm -rf`-ing files, this script moves things to the trash
- Prompts you to confirm deletion of files, so you don't accidentally mess something up
- Pretty colors

## How to install

- Download `ni-uninstall.sh`
- `chmod +x` it
- If you don't know how to work with shell scripts, ask Claude for best practices
